TODO List:
    * Rotation
    * Snapping, make small rotations if needed (like 60*)
    * Grouping and Detaching from group

    * Detect when solved
        * Fade out pieces bump-map / highlights
        * Show dialog when solved, display time

    * Shadows
        * Gaussian blur IIR filter for cairo surface
        * NOTE: Clutter offers its own depth control, so shadows need to be 
          rendered on a bottom-most actor; or we can draw rectangle on different Z, 
          with material set to enable depth test
    
    * Highlights
        * Puzzle.Piece creates normal-map / bump-map
        * Write a GLSL shader (sort of phong model)
        * Make a fallback if GLSL not supported, just draw outlines
    
    * New Game dialog: select image and number of pieces
    * Save state on quit
    * Restore on startup
    * Leave fullscreen button, if in fullscreen mode

    * Throwing pieces
        * Just add Clutter.SwipeAction for every piece

    * Viewport:
        * Zoom
        * Scrollbars

    * Statusbar:
        * Timer, Number of pieces, Pieces left
        * Zoom slider

    * Optimizations
        * Make Puzzle.Edge class work only on cairo paths
        * Make Piece.path_optimized for Piece.pick()
        * Make Gaussian Blur use SSE or something
    
    * Write a User Manual

    * Write a nicer README file
    
    * Translate
    
    * Sounds

    * Open remote images by GIO
    
    * Command line args
        
    * Improve app icon smaller than 64x64
